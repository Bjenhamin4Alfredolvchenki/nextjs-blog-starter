You're creating a new blog, and it's come time to choose the tools that you'll build it with. I can't speak to the pros or cons of all the options, but I can share what's caused me to choose Next over and over. 

## Markdown
It's a blog. We're here for the content. You shouldn't be wrangling HTML or CSS. You should be writing. Creating. That's it. And that's exactly what markdown lets you do.

## Statically generated
Need to show the same page to a bunch of users? Generate it at build. When your users ask for your content, deliver it lightning fast. 

## Image optimization
Defer images you don't need, and prioritize the ones you do. All the while, making sure you're serving up the smallest size possible without sacrificing quality. 

## React
A fast, robust library, with a ton of tools available to help you get the job done, without reinventing the wheel. 

## APIs

Volutpat consequat mauris nunc congue nisi vitae. Id aliquet risus feugiat in ante metus dictum at tempor. Sed blandit libero volutpat sed cras. Sed odio morbi quis commodo odio aenean sed adipiscing. Velit euismod in pellentesque massa placerat. Mi bibendum neque egestas congue quisque egestas diam in arcu. Nisi lacus sed viverra tellus in. Nibh cras pulvinar mattis nunc sed. Luctus accumsan tortor posuere ac ut consequat semper viverra. Fringilla ut morbi tincidunt augue interdum velit euismod.
